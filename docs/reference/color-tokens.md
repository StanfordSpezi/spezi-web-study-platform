# Color tokens reference

This document provides a reference for the semantic color tokens used in the study platform. Each token is designed to express a specific visual intent, ensuring consistency and clarity across the user interface. Learn more about the design of the [semantic color token system](../explanations/styling.md#semantic-color-tokens).

## Global Tokens

### Background

These styles apply to the background color of an element, typically used for larger areas like the main content area or sidebars.

#### Default

##### Primary

- `bg`: Used for the main background of the application, providing a neutral base for content.
- `bg-hover`: Used to style the hover state of elements that sit on the primary background.
- `bg-active`: Used to style the active state of elements that sit on the primary background.

##### Secondary

- `bg-secondary`: Used for secondary backgrounds, such as sidebars or secondary content areas, providing a subtle yet distinct visual separation from the primary background.
- `bg-secondary-hover`: Used to style the hover state of elements that sit on a secondary background.
- `bg-secondary-active`: Used to style the active state of elements that sit on a secondary background.

#### Examples

```tsx
<Layout>
  <Sidebar className="bg-bg-secondary">
    <SidebarItem className="hover:bg-bg-secondary-hover active:bg-bg-secondary-active" />
  </Sidebar>
  <MainContent className="bg-bg">
    <GhostButton className="hover:bg-bg-hover active:bg-bg-active" />
  </MainContent>
</Layout>
```

### Layer

These styles apply to larger elements that sit on top of the background, such as cards, panels, or other "container-like" UI components that require a distinct visual separation from the background.

#### Default

##### Primary

- `layer`: Used for elements that sit on the primary background, such as cards or panels, providing a subtle elevation effect.
- `layer-hover`: Used to style the hover state of elements that sit on the primary layer.

#### Examples

```tsx
<Background className="bg-bg">
  <Card className="bg-layer">
    <GhostButton className="hover:bg-layer-hover" />
  </Card>
</Background>
```

### Fill

These styles apply to smaller elements that require a solid fill color, such as buttons or badges. Fills come with their explicit text colors, called `on-fill` tokens, to ensure good contrast and readability.

#### Default

##### Primary

- `fill`: Used for elements that require a solid neutral fill color that does not express a specific intent and does not fit a particular role.

##### Secondary

- `fill-secondary`: Used for elements that require a solid neutral fill color that does not express a specific intent and is darker than the primary fill color.

##### Tertiary

- `fill-tertiary`: Used for elements that require a solid neutral fill color that does not express a specific intent and is darker than the secondary fill color.

#### Brand

##### Primary

- `fill-brand`: Used for elements that require a solid fill color that draws a lot of attention to an element without conveying a specific context, such as an error or success state.
- `fill-brand-hover`: Used to style the hover state of elements that use the brand fill color.
- `fill-brand-active`: Used to style the active state of elements that use the brand fill color.

#### Info

##### Primary

- `fill-info`: Used for elements that require a solid fill color that indicates informational content or commands a little bit of attention. It should be used to put emphasis on elements that don't require action but still need to be noticed.

#### Success

##### Primary

- `fill-success`: Used for elements that require a solid fill color that indicates a successful or positive action or state, such as a completed task or successful submission.

#### Warning

##### Primary

- `fill-warning`: Used for elements that require a solid fill color that indicates a warning action or pending state, such as a potential issue or caution.

#### Critical

##### Primary

- `fill-critical`: Used for elements that require a solid fill color that indicates an error or high importance state, such as a failed action or critical alert.

#### Examples

```tsx
<Table>
  <TableRow className="bg-fill" />
  <TableRow className="bg-fill-secondary" />
  <TableFooter className="bg-fill-tertiary" />
</Table>
```

### Border

These styles apply to the border or ring color of elements, typically used for outlines or borders around cards, buttons, and other UI components.

#### Default

##### Primary

- `border`: Used for elements that require an unopinionated strong border color to provide visual separation or emphasis without conveying a specific intent.
- `border-focus`: Used to style the border color of elements when they are focused, ensuring good visibility and accessibility.

##### Secondary

##### Tertiary

- `border-tertiary`: Used for elements that require an unopinionated border color that is even less prominent than the secondary border.

#### Info

##### Primary

- `border-info`: Used for elements that require a border color that indicates informational content or commands a little bit of attention, such as an informational card or alert.

#### Examples

```tsx
<Card className="border-border border">
