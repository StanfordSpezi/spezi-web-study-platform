- Remove any content that reads like a tutorial or guide
- Keep descriptions neutral by removing opinions and recommendations
- Write entries that can stand alone without context from other sections
- Include cross-references only when they clarify technical relationships
- Group related items by technical similarity, not by use case
- Write descriptions that work both in isolation and as part of a broader documentation
- Include version-specific information directly with the feature, not in a separate section
- Document limitations as inherent properties, not as warnings
- Structure content to support both browsing and direct access
- Write for lookup and verification, not for learning
