- Use sentence case for all headings and titles (capitalize only the first word and proper nouns)
- Start each instruction step with an imperative verb (e.g., “Click”, “Select”, “Enter”, “Check”)
- Always use the same word for the same concept throughout the guide
- Write guides that help users achieve a specific, practical goal
- Always address a real-world problem or task from the user’s perspective—not from the perspective of the tool or system
- Avoid open-ended or overly broad topics. Focus on clear, well-defined outcomes
- Assume the user is already competent in the domain and knows what they want to do
- Do not include basic explanations or background knowledge; link to reference material if needed
- Start with a clear statement of what the guide will help the user accomplish
- Provide a logical, actionable sequence of steps that lead to the goal
- Each step should be an action (physical, mental, or judgment-based) that moves the user closer to the outcome
- Allow for real-world complexity: include forks, options, or adaptations where necessary
- Only include what is required to achieve the task; everything else should be referenced or omitted
- Ensure the sequence of steps matches the natural workflow and thinking of the user
- Minimize context-switching and unnecessary backtracking
- Maintain a smooth pace and rhythm in instructions
- Use precise, goal-oriented titles that state exactly what the guide achieves (e.g., "How to configure email notifications")
- Avoid vague or generic titles
- Use direct, imperative language ("Do X to achieve Y")
- Use conditional imperatives where relevant ("If you want X, do Y")
- Avoid teaching, discussion, or background context within the guide
- Where possible, make the guide adaptable to similar but not identical use cases
- Recognize that not all real-world problems are linear or procedural; allow for judgment and adaptation
- Place warnings and important limitations before, not after, the related content
- Remove any content that makes users question if they're in the right place
- Structure content to match the user's state of mind, not the system's architecture
- Break long procedures at natural pause points where users might step away
- Include subtle contextual hints that help users confirm they're on the right track
