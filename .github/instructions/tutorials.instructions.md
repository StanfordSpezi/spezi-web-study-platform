- Treat the tutorial as a lesson in a contrived environment that you fully control
- Take full responsibility for learner success and never require prior recall during the flow
- State the concrete end artifact up front as something the learner will build
- Make every step yield a visible and meaningful result that the learner can verify
- Maintain a running expectation narrative and show example outputs at each checkpoint
- Flag likely failure signs immediately after the step that can cause them
- Tell the learner what to notice so observation closes the learning loop
- Engineer natural reset points so learners can retry without starting from scratch
- Prefer reversible actions and provide quick start-over instructions when they are not reversible
- Remove options and alternatives that distract from the single path to success
- Keep explanations minimal and link out for any background the learner might want later
- Write in the first person plural to affirm tutor and learner working together
- Pin versions and seed the environment so nothing unexpected can derail the lesson
- Use disposable or mock resources to avoid side effects and cleanup burdens
- Prepare the learner for surprising effects such as long logs or delayed responses
- Conclude with a clear moment of achievement that reinforces the learnerâ€™s confidence
